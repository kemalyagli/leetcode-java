Welcome to my personal collection of LeetCode problem solutions written in **Java**.  
This repository is part of my ongoing effort to improve my algorithmic thinking and prepare for software development interviews.

## ðŸš€ About

Each problem is organized into its own Java class.  
I focus not only on solving problems but also on writing clean code with clear comments that explain the reasoning and common Java behaviors.

## ðŸ›  How to Use

You can run or test any solution using `Main.java`.  
Each class is written with `public static` methods so they can be easily tested and reused.
